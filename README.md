# x50ng -- HP 50g hardware level emulator
This is my fork of x49gp

## Usage
`x50ng --help`


## Tips & tricks

- _arigit_: For anyone having the "slow keystroke issue" for repeated keystrokes, this is easily fixable by configuring the calculator with "300" as the KEYTIME value (the default value on a stock HP 50g is `1138`.)

To issue the KEYTIME command on the HP50g calculator, follow these steps:

   1. Enter the desired KEYTIME value (e.g., 500) on the stack
   2. Press [RIGHT-SHIFT] followed by the key to produce the right arrow (â†’) symbol
   3. Type "KEYTIME" using the [ALPHA] key for each letter
   4. Press [ENTER] to execute the command

Problem solved (reference: [1](https://www.site2241.net/october2008.htm) [2](https://www.hpmuseum.org/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/hpmuseum/archv016.cgi?read=107543) )


## Compilation
`make INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr`

### Dependencies
- `lua` (`luajit` also works, see `LUA_VERSION` in `Makefile`)
- `gtk+3`


## Installation

0. I advise you to download the necessary firmware and ROM from https://hpcalc.org/ by running `make pull-firmware`
1. Run `sudo make install INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr` (see the Makefile to see what variables your can override.)


## Run

*A configuration and data folder is automatically created and populated in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/x50ng/` (typically `~/.config/x50ng/`)*

### If you have installed x50ng
#### First run
1. launch the emulator by running `./dist/x50ng`
2. in the file chooser dialog navigate to the folder */usr/share/x50ng/firmware/hp4950v215/2MB_FIX/* then click _Open_ (if no dialog shows up: right-click on the screen and choose _Mount SD Folder..._)
   (if prompted: in the emulator press the key _2_)
3. follow instructions if prompted, enjoy your virtual HP 50g
4. you can right-click on the screen and choose _Unmount SD_

### Run Locally without installation
#### First run
1. You will need to download the necessary firmware and ROM from https://hpcalc.org/ by running `make pull-firmware`
2. launch the emulator by running `./dist/x50ng`
3. in the file chooser dialog navigate to the folder *./dist/firmware/hp4950v215/2MB_FIX/* then click _Open_ (if no dialog shows up: right-click on the screen and choose _Mount SD Folder..._)
   (if prompted: in the emulator press the key _2_)
4. follow instructions if prompted, enjoy your virtual HP 50g
5. you can right-click on the screen and choose _Unmount SD_



## Development

- `make` to compile with all warnings
- `make clean` and `make mrproper` to clean between compilation runs
- `make pretty-code` to format the code using `clang-format` and the provided `.clang-format`


## Post fork todo-list:

* [DONE] first port `gtk+-2` code to `gtk+-3`
  - https://docs.gtk.org/gtk3/migrating-2to3.html
* [DONE] make it nicer in `gtk+-3`
* [TODO] then port `gtk+-3` code to `gtk4`
  - https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/migrating-3to4.html
